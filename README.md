# 🩸 Menstrual Cycle Tracker App (Console-based)

This is a simple Java-based menstrual cycle tracking app I’m building to help users calculate important cycle dates — such as the flow start date, ovulation, fertile window, and safe period.

The idea started when I caught my babe calculating her safe period with a calendar and I asked, “You dey expect alert?” 😂 She said no, she was just trying to plan ahead. That moment sparked this project.

## 💡 What the App Does

- Accepts last menstrual period date and cycle length
- Calculates:
    - Next period date
    - Ovulation date
    - Fertile window
    - Safe periods (before & after ovulation)
- Built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** principles

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- JUnit (for testing)
- Git (for version control)

---

## 🧪 TDD & BDD Approach

I’m developing this app using:
- **TDD**: Writing unit tests first, then writing the code to pass those tests
- **BDD**: Describing the behavior in human-readable terms, and making sure features align with user expectations (e.g., “As a user, I want to know my ovulation window…”)

## 🚀 What’s Next

- Add command-line interaction for users
- Include real-life variability (e.g., irregular cycles)
- Deploy to a simple GUI or Android version in future
- Improve TDD/BDD test coverage
- Share with real users for feedback

## 👨🏾‍💻 Why I’m Building This

This isn’t just a coding exercise — it’s personal, practical, and a way for me to build something useful while growing my Java and testing skills. One step at a time, one cycle at a time 😉
